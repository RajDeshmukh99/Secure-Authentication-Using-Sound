# Secure-Authentication-Using-Sound
Traditionally text-based pins have been used to authenticate a secure connection between devices. But with the advancement in technology leading to a variety of cyber-attacks, the pins are not secure enough. So, there is a need for something more secure than pins to share sensitive data. The project will discuss a way to authenticate a connection between two devices using sound. This eliminates the task of manually verifying the pins and also provides higher security than pin-based authentication or QR authentication. The system uses Ultrasound audio to pair up the devices. A random audio is recorded, shuffled, encrypted and then transmitted in short burst using the deviceâ€™s speakers. The other device captures these audio burst using its microphone and decrypts the audio to get the required data for pairing. Near Sound Data Transfer (NSDT) creates an electronic signature through sound and eliminates the need of complicated ciphers and encryption algorithms. This model only requires two devices with speakers and microphone and no extra hardware requirement like qr code requires a camera.
